## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this suitable for real engineering design?**  
A: No - OpenCivil is an **educational tool**. Use commercial software (SAP2000, ETABS, etc.) for actual building design. However, OpenCivil's results are validated to match commercial software accuracy for learning purposes.

**Q: How accurate are the results?**  
A: OpenCivil has been validated against industry-standard commercial FEM software and shows 6-7 decimal place agreement for all analysis types. See the Validation section above for details.

**Q: Can I use OpenCivil for my thesis/research?**  
A: Yes! Export the matrices and results for your analysis. The solver has been validated for accuracy. Please cite the software if used in publications.

**Q: Does it support plate/shell elements?**  
A: Not yet - currently only 3D beam/frame elements. Plates are on the roadmap.

**Q: Why is the Turkish Seismic Code included?**  
A: The developer is based in Turkey, and TBDY 2018 integration makes it valuable for Turkish students and engineers learning seismic design. The implementation has been validated against TBDY 2018 examples.

**Q: Can I run this on Mac/Linux?**  
A: Currently Windows-only via installer. If you run from source (Python), it *should* work on Mac/Linux but is untested.

**Q: How can I verify the accuracy myself?**  
A: Use the Matrix Spy tool to export stiffness matrices and compare with hand calculations or other software. The transparent nature of OpenCivil allows full verification of all calculations.
